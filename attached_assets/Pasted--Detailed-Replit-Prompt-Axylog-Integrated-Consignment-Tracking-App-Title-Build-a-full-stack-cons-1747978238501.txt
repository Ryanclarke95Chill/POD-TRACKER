✅ Detailed Replit Prompt – Axylog-Integrated Consignment Tracking App
Title:
Build a full-stack consignment tracking app for an Australian transport company integrated with Axylog

📌 Overview:
Create a customer-facing web application where users can log in and view only their own consignments. Consignments are pulled from the Axylog API, using the delivery address email to match users to their shipments.

Use Australian locations and include filters for temperature-controlled freight types: Dry, Chiller (0–4°C), Freezer (-20°C), Wine (14°C), Confectionery (15–20°C), Pharma (2–8°C).

🧩 Tech Stack
Frontend: React + TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js + Express

Auth: Email-based login using demo credentials

API: Integrate Axylog API for live consignment data

Data Matching: Match consignments using the delivery address email to user login

🔐 Axylog Integration Instructions
🔑 Step 1: Get Axylog API Credentials
Ask your Axylog support contact to provide:

Username & Password (for API service login)

Company ID

Context Owner ID

User ID
These can be extracted from the /authentication/service response.

✉️ Step 2: Authentication Request
Use the /authentication/service POST endpoint:

json
Copy
Edit
POST https://api.axylog.com/authentication/service
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "username": "your-axylog-username",
  "password": "your-axylog-password"
}
This returns a JSON with:

token

userTree.userId

userTree.companiesOwners[0].company

userTree.companiesOwners[0].contextOwners[0].contextOwner

Save these values as environment variables or in your session.

📦 Step 3: Get Deliveries (Consignments)
Use the /Deliveries?v=2 endpoint with POST:

Copy
Edit
POST https://api.axylog.com/Deliveries?v=2
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ContextOwner: <contextOwnerId>
  User: <userId>
  Company: <companyId>
  SourceDeviceType: 3
  Content-Type: application/json

    "pickUp_Delivery_To": "2024-12-31T21:59:00.000Z"
